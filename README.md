UI Concerns
===========

A non-widget UI library for jQuery
----------------------------------

As the name suggests, UI Concerns plugins will each seek to encapsulate a
particular concern that you can apply to a wide variety of sites and situations.
Themes will be avoided, as the goal is to automate repetitious but complex
DOM-manipulation activities. Styling is generally left as a separate concern.
Sometimes design elements may be provided as reasonable defaults.

Status
------

Any plugin included here exists because I needed it for a production site.
Thus, each of them has been tested in at least one site. However, use at
your own risk. If you understand and like the way they're coded, please
make use of it, modify anything you need to, and send pull requests for 
any improvements that others might find useful.
